title: About
---
My name is AM Freilich and I'm a software engineer at the Embark Corporation in NYC. I used to be a theoretical computer science PhD student. These days I spend most of my time at work coding in javascript (we use a MEAN stack). In my personal coding I like to use Haskell and emacs. My other hobbies including playing mediocre covers of the Mountain Goats on the acoustic guitar, cooking food from my CSA and sewing clothes.
